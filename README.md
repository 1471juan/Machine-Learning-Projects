# Small machine learning projects
These are exercises and small projects.

# Words classification
This is an Naive Bayes classification exercise from https://www.mooc.fi/en

This project implements a machine learning model that classifies words as either Finnish or English.
It reads word lists from files, processes them, and uses a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to predict the language of unseen words. 
Cross-validation is used to evaluate the model's performance.

# Clustering German sentences
This project applies unsupervised machine learning to a custom dataset of German sentences to explore semantic clustering. Using K-Means clustering, the goal was to group similar sentences based on vocabulary usage.
To visualize and interpret clusters, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied for dimenssion reduction. Clustering quality/accuracy was assessed using the silhouette score.
