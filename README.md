# Machine learning projects
These are exercises and projects. A readme file containing the analysis/report is included where relevant.

# Crime clarification analysis with Probit model
Analyisis of crime reports in Uruguay and prediction of whether a case will be clarified using a Probit regression model.
It includes data cleaning, exporatory analysis, and evaluation of the model performance.

# Wage and salary earnings multivariate linear regression
The objective of this project is to build a regression model that explains variations in wages across industries and demographics for the US, using a population survey. The project includes exploring the variables from tables with SQL, preparing the variables in a csv file, processing the data, evaluating the model and interpreting the coefficients.

The results are that wages increase with age, education, hours worked, and in some industries. Women earn on average less than men, ceteris paribus. Being married, capital income, and better health are all associated with higher wages. Being foreign born(not US citizen), earning alternative income sources, poor health, larger households, and hourly work are associated with lower wage and salary earnings. Race doesn't seem to be significant.

# Words classification
This is an Naive Bayes classification exercise from https://www.mooc.fi/en

This project implements a machine learning model that classifies words as either Finnish or English.
It reads word lists from files, processes them, and uses a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to predict the language of unseen words. 
Cross-validation is used to evaluate the model's performance.

# Clustering German sentences
This project applies unsupervised machine learning to a custom dataset of German sentences to explore semantic clustering. Using K-Means clustering, the goal was to group similar sentences based on vocabulary usage.
To visualize and interpret clusters, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied for dimenssion reduction. Clustering quality/accuracy was assessed using the silhouette score.
