# Words classification
This is an Naive Bayes classification exercise from https://www.mooc.fi/en

This project implements a machine learning model that classifies words as either Finnish or English.
It reads word lists from files, processes them, and uses a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to predict the language of unseen words. 
Cross-validation is used to evaluate the model's performance.
